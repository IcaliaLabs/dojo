# Dojo

The Dojo is Icalia Labs' software development trainee program. It was designed with the purpose of standardizing the basic programming and software engineering skills level required of new Icaliers before joining new or existing software development projects. 

Although the Dojo is primarily concerned with training new Icalia Labs Software Engineering Interns, any Icalier, at any level, will find useful guides, information, practice exercises and example code within this repository.

The Dojo currently contains resources for learning the following tools and technologies:

### Backend
