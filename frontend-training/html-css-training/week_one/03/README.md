DAY 3 - FLEXBOX & LAYOUTS

## Lesson Objectives

After this stage the trainee should be able to:

+ Understand what the display flex property is.
+ Learn all the properties that depend on the flex property and their uses.
+ Understand basic layouts for different kind of elements like navigations, blogs, sidebars and cards using flex.

 ## Lesson

This lesson consists as an introduction to understand the basic principles of flex along with other properties that work with it and also to create basic design UI layouts to create most websites.

+ Explain and demo:
  + Display: `flex`
  + `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `order`, `flex-flow`, `align-content`, `order`, `align-self`.
+ Layout of basic UI web elements.

The [lesson.html](lesson/lesson.html) and [lesson/stylesheet.css](lesson/assets/stylesheet.css) files in this directory contains commented code examples for all of these concepts. The [index.html](index.html) and it’s [stylesheet.css](assets/stylesheet.css) file has the exact same markup without the comments. These files can also be opened in the browser to demonstrate the effects of the HTML markup and the CSS style.

## Practice

Each trainee will practice the previously covered theory by writing CSS code according to the following instructions/requirements:

### Web Developer Portfolio

In this exercise, you will continue to create your own web developer portfolio by replacing the page layout by one that feels more like what the page needs and replace the css code with flex where it’s neeeded. (If you already have a convincing layout you can keep it, but  the reviewer can ask for changes)

*For this exercise, only the structure is mandatory. Copy (content text) placeholders (Lorem Ipsum for text, placehold.it for images) may be used.*

1. All the points that were requested the past two days.

2. Add at least two layout elements:
  1. Feature List
  2. Card
  3. Header
  4. Footer
  5. Gallery
  6. Sidebar element

3. You must (at least) use the following CSS flex properties:
+ `display:flex`, `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, justify-content`, `align-items`, `order`, `flex-flow`, `align-content`, `order`, `align-self`.

Check out the [practice/](practice/) subdirectory in this directory, which you can use to continue building your static portfolio.
