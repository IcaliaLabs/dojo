/* Your Web Developer Portfolio 

In this exercise, you will continue to create your own web developer portfolio by replacing the page layout by one that feels more like what the page needs and replace the css code with flex where itâ€™s neeeded. (If you already have a convincing layout you can keep it, but  the reviewer can ask for changes)

*For this exercise, only the structure is mandatory. Copy (content text) placeholders (Lorem Ipsum for text, placehold.it for images) may be used.*

1. All the points that were requested the past two days.

2. Add at least two layout elements:
  1. Feature List
  2. Card
  3. Header
  4. Footer
  5. Gallery
  6. Sidebar element

3. You must (at least) use the following CSS flex properties:
+ `display:flex`, `flex-direction`, `flex-wrap`, justify-content`, `align-items`, `order`, `flex-flow`, `align-content`, `order`, `align-self`.
