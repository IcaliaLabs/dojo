# 01 - Introduction to HTML

## Lesson Objectives

After this training stage the trainee should be able to:

+ Correctly utilize the basic elements of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).
+ Understand the meaning of "markup" and the difference between writing markup and programming.
+ Write simple web pages by using the basic HTML tags and elements.
+ Understand the purposes and functions of different HTML container tags (i.e. `<div>` v.s. `<main>` v.s. `span`).
+ Recognize and apply the fundamental attributes and their values for each of the main HTML elements.
  
## Lesson

This lesson consists of a detailed exploration of the HTML syntax, elements and their uses and attributes.

+ Demonstrate the overall structure of a static HTML file (and explain why it is considered static)
+ Explain and demo:
  + Heading Tags: `<h1>`,`<h2>`,`<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
  + Paragraph Tags: `<p>`
  + Image Tags: `<img>`
  + Anchor Tags: `<a>`
  + List Tags: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<il>`
  + Layout and Grouping Tags: `<div>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<span>`, `<header>`, `<footer>`, etc.
  + Table Tags: `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<th>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`
  + Form Tags: `<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>`

The [lesson.html](/lesson.html) file in this directory contains commented code examples for all of these concepts. This file can also be opened in the browser to demonstrate the effects of the HTML markup.

## Practice

In order to complete this practice exercise, checkout the [practice.html(/practice.html) file for the exercise template.

Each trainee will practice the previously covered theory by writing a Ruby script according to the following instructions/requirements:

In this exercise, you will start to create your own web developer portfolio by writing all the necessary basic markup.

*For this exercise, only the structure is mandatory. Copy (content text) placeholders (Lorem Ipsum for text, placehold.it for images) may be used.*

1. Your web portfolio can be either a single page with different sections or multiple linked pages.
2. You must (at least) include the following sections (the names don't have to match):
   1. Landing page (Home)
   2. About Me (Bio)
   3. Projects (Experience/CV)
   4. Contact (E-mail and phone info or contact form)
3. You must (at least) use the following HTML elements:
   1. `<html>`, `<body`, `<header>`, `<footer>` tags
   2. Heading tags
   3. Paragraph tags
   4. Image tags
   5. Anchor tags (links)
   6. List tags
   7. Layout and grouping tags (esp. `<div>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<span>`)
   8. Tables and forms are optional but encouraged

Check out the [practice/](/practice/) subdirectory in this directory, which you can use to start building your static portfolio.
