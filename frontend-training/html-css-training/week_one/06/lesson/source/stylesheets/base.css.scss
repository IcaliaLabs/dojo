//CSS folder Architecture

/*
In this lesson we will divide correctly the bases.scss file from the day05 so it's more readable.
*/

//vendor
/* 
Here it goes all the externals stylesheets that you need, could be frameworks, plugins, 
libraries, etc.

It goes first becuase vendor stylesheets are the first step on the cascade system so it can be 
overwriten if needed.
*/

//settings
/*
Here it goes the main files needed for run the styles, for example here goes three very 
important files, because of the importance of these files they must go second.
*/
@import 'settings/resets'; /* when vendors doesn't have resets for the elements default values */
@import 'settings/variables'; /* File with all the variables of the project. */
@import 'settings/typography'; /*  We locate all code relating to text, fonts, titles and other typography related rules. */
@import 'settings/functions'; /* We locate here the functions and mixins of the project. */

//elements
/*
Here it goes all the “single” elements (think like an single atom of a component), 
for example a button, an “avatar”.

Elements should be the third option cause it's lees specific than pages or shame
*/
@import 'elements/header';
@import 'elements/footer';
@import 'elements/button';
@import 'elements/input';
@import 'elements/layouts';

//pages
/*
Here it goes the specific styles need for tweak things in specific pages, for example 
if you need to separate to specific buttons with and specific _page-name.scss.

Pages are the fourth because these will be styles that only will be used on a specific page
*/
@import 'pages/home';

//utilities
@import 'utilities';

//shame
/*
Here it goes all the styles that needed the !important declaration or another form of overwrite.

Shame it's the most specific because the !important declaration and the overwrite 
that this coudl do
*/
@import 'shame';
