This site.css.scss whit SASS a css file can be separated with partial files and the @import
option 
*/

/* Partials */
/* 
Partial files are files that contain snippet of CSS to make a sass stylesheet easier to read
and to organize, partials files are declared with an underscore '_partialname.scss' this way the
compiler knows that the file is part of another .css file and doesn't create a separate .css file
*/

/* Imports */
/*
To use a partial file you need to declare it whit a @import option, the syntax of the import is
@import 'filename'; import only needs the file name whitout the underscore and the file extension.

An important thing to remember it's that Cascade system still be working with the the partial files
and the order that you place the variables is very important.

@import 'base'; /* this partial file has the general code */
@import 'mediaquery'; /* this partial file has the code for the media queries */
