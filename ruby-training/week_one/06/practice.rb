# Taking the code from the lesson:
# 1. Instead of having a hash representing the elements, change it to classes and objects
# 2. Get the total sales for the movies
# 3. Get the average score

# The second part for this practice is to scrap https://youtube.com and get the feature videos
# 1. Use classes to represent the video
#   1.1 Get the title, author, views_count, time_ago, url
# 2. Use a class to represent the scrapping client
# 3. Export the videos to a CSV file
