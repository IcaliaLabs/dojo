# 03 - Data and Behavior Encapsulation in Ruby

## Lesson Objectives

After this training stage the trainee should be able to: 

+ Read, understand and be able to customize or modify independent Ruby files containing one or multiple classes or modules.
+ Use existing classes and modules in their own Ruby scripts.
+ Implement single inheritance between classes.
+ Include and use modules withing classes and vice-versa.
+ Understand and leverage different scopes.
+ Design, code and implement their own classes and modules to be used and reused.
+ Understand the difference between instance variables and methods, and class variables and methods.
+ Use the getter and setter generation (`attr_reader`, `attr_writer` and `attr_accessor`) methods correctly.
  

## Lesson

This lesson consists of a detailed exploration of the Ruby syntax and conventions related to data and behavior encapsulation in the Ruby language.


The [lesson.rb](/lesson.rb) file in this directory contains commented code examples for all of these concepts.

## Practice 

In order to complete this practice exercise, checkout the [practice.rb](/practice.rb) file for the exercise template.

Each trainee will practice the previously covered theory by writing a Ruby script according to the following instructions/requirements:

1. Design and implement a project assignment shuffler that assigns developers working at Icalia Labs to different projects.
2. Every developer must be matched with two other members.
3. Every developer has more or less the same amount of projects assigned to them.
4. Build as many classes as you think you need.
5. Refactor wherever possible.
6. The code at the bottom of the [practice.rb](/practice.rb) file must run without errors.
