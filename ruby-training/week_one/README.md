# Dojo Traning Plan - Week One

## Week One - Ruby Training
This directory contains a full week's worth of lessons, practice exercises and relevant resources that cover **Week One**'s training syllabus. Each numbered subdirectory contains resources (files, documents and relevant links) for the respective training day (starting at 01).

## Table of contents
* [01 - Start the engine](01)
* [02 - Down to first](02)
* [03 - Up to speed up](03)
* [04 - Hit it grandma](04)
* [05 - Emergency break](05)
* [06 - Get to second](06)
* [07 - Feel the heat](07)
* [08 - Hear the engine](08)

## Setting Up

Before we jump into Ruby, we must first set up our environment. In order to be able to write and execute Ruby scripts and programs, we must first have an updated version of Ruby installed.

Trainees using macOS will find that Ruby is installed by default on their machines. Other OS users must install both Ruby and a Ruby version manager (Icalia Labs strongly recommends you use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv))



## Things to keep in mind about Ruby

* It is an interpreted programming language
* It is not strongly typed
* It has an interactive console through the `irb` command
* Its philosophy is to keep the developer **happy**
* Everything in Ruby is an **object**
* It always returns some object, no `void` methods
* `dot-notation` is always present



## Code conventions



* Use snake case for variable and method naming
* Use camel case for naming your classes/modules
* Use `UTF-8` for file encoding
* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
  should end in a question mark.
* The names of potentially "dangerous" methods (i.e. methods that modify `self` or the
  arguments, `exit!`, etc.) should end with an exclamation mark.
