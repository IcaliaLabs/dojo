## Setting Up

Before we jump into Ruby, we must first set up our environment. In order to be able to 



## Things to keep in mind about Ruby

* It is an interpreted programming language
* It is not strongly typed
* It has an interactive console through the `irb` command
* Its philosophy is to keep the developer **happy**
* Everything in Ruby is an **object**
* It always returns some object, no `void` methods
* `dot-notation` is always present



## Code conventions



* Use snake case for variable and method naming
* Use camel case for naming your classes/modules
* Use `UTF-8` for file encoding
* Use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
* The names of predicate methods (methods that return a boolean value)
  should end in a question mark.
* The names of potentially "dangerous" methods (i.e. methods that modify `self` or the
  arguments, `exit!`, etc.) should end with an exclamation mark.
