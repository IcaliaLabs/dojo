# 02 - Functions and Methods in Ruby

## Lesson Objectives

After this training stage the trainee should be able to: 
+ Declare and write functions/methods in a global scope to carry out simple operations
+ Design function signatures with conventionally acceptable method names and a reasonable amount and selection of function parameters.
+ Call and execute functions/methods of their own design in global scope scripts to solve more complex problems/exercises
+ Apply conventional method naming and calling practices in special circumstances (Predicate `?` and Mutator `!` methods, when to use parentheses, the "hash as last parameter" rule, etc...)
+ Recognize and write methods with Blocks, Procs and Lambdas in Ruby
  

## Lesson

This lesson consists of a detailed exploration of the Ruby syntax and conventions of method and function writing in a global scope (without getting into code grouping or instance/class method distinction).

+ Introduce method blocks and their scope with the `def` and `end` keywords
+ The `return` keyword and implicit returns
+ No return or parameter types
+ Default attribute values (optional parameters)
+ Optional parentheses
+ Method calls
+ Blocks & Yield
+ Anonymous functions (Lambda)
+ Functional programming in Ruby (`.map()`, `.reduce()`, etc.)
+ Higher order functions

The [lesson.rb](/lesson.rb) file in this directory contains commented code examples for all of these concepts.

## Practice 

In order to complete this practice exercise, checkout the [practice.rb](/practice.rb) file for the exercise template.

Each trainee will practice the previously covered theory by writing a Ruby script according to the following instructions/requirements:

In this exercise, you will write a script to set up core reviews for all reviewees.

The rules for the script are:

1. Two **random** reviewers per reviewee
2. When the reviewers are selected, send an e-mail to the reviewee informing them of the selection (print the e-mail contents to the console)
3. After the email is sent, create a txt file format of the email for each reviewee, with the following format:

```
E-mail to: kurenn@icalialabs.com
Body:

Hi, Abraham Kuri.
Your reviewers are HÃ©ctor and Vov.
```

4. Constant global arrays for `REVIEWERS` and `REVIEWEES` have already been provided in the `practice.rb` code template. Please use these as the 'database' your script.
