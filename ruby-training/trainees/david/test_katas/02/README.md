# FizzBuzz Kata

### Description

Imagine the scene. You are eleven years old, and in the five minutes before the end of the lesson, your Maths teacher decides he should make his class more "fun" by introducing a "game". He explains that he is going to point at each pupil in turn and ask them to say the next number in sequence, starting from one. The "fun" part is that if the number is divisible by three, you instead say "Fizz" and if it is divisible by five you say "Buzz".

#### Step 1

Create a FizzBuzz playing game. The play method will receive a number and play FizzBuzz with it. 

1. Numbers divisible by 3, the game says "Fizz"
2. Numbers divisible by 5, the game says "Buzz"
3. Numbers divisible by 3 **and** 5, the game says "FizzBuzz"
4. Another number the game says that number

#### Step 2

1. The game says "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3 **or** if it has a 3 in it
2. The game says "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 **or** if it has a 5 in it
