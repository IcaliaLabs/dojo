# Dojo Ruby Traning Plan - Week Two

## Week Overview

This directory contains a full week's worth of lessons, practice exercises and relevant resources that cover **Week Two**'s training syllabus. Each numbered subdirectory contains resources (files, documents and relevant links) for the respective training day (starting at 01).

## Objective

The main objectives for the second week of training are for the trainees to:

* Take their knowledge of the Ruby language into a Web Development context
* Learn the Test Driven Development practice, particularly through RSpec Unit tests

By the end of the week, the trainee should be able to write Ruby programs that interact with Web-based resources as well as simple RSpec tests to ensure their code works as expected.
